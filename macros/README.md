# Zipper Macros

This repository contains the helper attribute proc macros for the zipper smart contract on Solana that build all of the `Accounts` structs and instructions expected by anchor's `#[derive(Accounts)]` and `#[program]`, respectively. These two procedural macro attributes are `#[token_account_struct]` and `#[verify]`.
