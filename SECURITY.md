This smart contract does not invoke any other programs, and only requests read access to all accounts passed in.

As such, no SOL or SPL token transfers can be carried out so there exists no attack vector for taking user funds.

This can, however, cause transactions that may otherwise be successful to fail.

Despite this, if you somehow manage to find an attack vector.. Congratulations! You have defied all logic.
